    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>"They know nothing about the War in Greenland," said M.
    DANGAARD IENSEN to a contemporary, and now the Intelligence
    Department is wondering whether it didn't perhaps choose the
    wrong colour after all for its tabs.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Governor of Greenland, giving evidence in the Prize
    Court last week, was greatly interested to learn that there was
    a well-known hymn, entitled "From Greenland's Icy Mountains."
    He was, however, inclined to think that the unfortunate
    reference to the rigorous nature of the climate would be
    resented by the local Publicity Committee, to whose notice he
    would feel it his duty to bring the matter when they were next
    thawed out.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Lord DEVONPORT has established his own Press Bureau, and it
    is rumoured that the Press Bureau is about to appoint its own
    Food Controller.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The American Line has advanced its First-Class fares by
    three pounds. It is hoped that this will effectually discourage
    Mr. HENRY FORD from visiting Europe for some time to come.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>The Times Literary Supplement</i> has received 335 books
    of original verse in 1916. And still the authorities pretend
    that juvenile crime is confined to the East End.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A telegram despatched from London on January 22nd, 1906,
    which contained a polling result of the General Election then
    in progress, has just been received by a Witham resident, who
    told the messenger there was no reply.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"If agriculture is to flourish," says <i>The Daily Mail</i>,
    "it must be so conducted as to pay." It is just this sordid
    commercialism that distorts the Carmelite point of view.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The German Union for the Development of the German Language
    have sent a petition to the CHANCELLOR, asking that in any
    future Peace negotiations the German language should be used.
    Will German frightfulness never cease?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Anybody in the Carmarthen district," says the local medical
    officer, "can keep a pig in the parlour if they keep it clean."
    The necessity of keeping the parlour clean for the sake of its
    guest will be easily understood by those who appreciate the
    fastidious taste of the pig.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Hungarian paper complains that the Government treats the
    War as if it were merely a family affair. This contrasts
    unfavourably with the more broadly hospitable attitude of the
    Allies, who have made it abundantly clear that so far as they
    are concerned anyone is welcome to join in and help their
    side.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The other day a Farnham bellringer, after cycling seventy
    miles, rang a peal of 5,940 changes. It is not known why.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"War diet," says Professor ROSIN in the <i>Lokal
    Anzeiger</i>, "improves the action of the heart." But what the
    Germans really want to know is, what improves a war diet?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Among the goods stolen from a Crouch Hill provision
    merchant's the other day were eight cheeses and ten hams. As
    the place was much littered it is thought that the cheeses put
    up a plucky fight.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is pointed out by experienced agriculturists that it is
    useless to plant potatoes unless steps are taken to destroy the
    insect pests. A Peterborough farmer has written a poem in
    <i>The Daily Express</i> against those pests, but we fancy that
    if a permanent improvement is to be effected it will be
    necessary to adopt much sterner measures than this.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The recent vagaries of the Weather Controller are said to be
    due to one of the new railway regulations, by which you are
    required to "Show all seasons, please."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Even Nature seems upset by the War. According to <i>The
    Evening Standard</i> primroses are blooming in a Harrow garden,
    while only the other day a pair of white spats were to be seen
    in the Strand.</p>

    <h2>Another Glimpse of the Obvious.</h2>

    <p>From the "Standing Orders" of a Military
    Hospital:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        "Officers confined to their beds will have their meals in
        their rooms."
    </blockquote>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        "A gale of great fury raged at Sheffield early on Tuesday
        morning. Much damage was done in the city and outlying
        districts, a number of beings being
        unroofed."&mdash;<i>Yorkshire Paper.</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Several others have been noticed to have a tile loose.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        "The welcome, amounting to an oration, which heralded the
        Prime Minister, was the most remarkable feature of a very
        remarkable occasion."&mdash;<i>Daily Dispatch.</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Is this quite kind to the subsequent speakers?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        "By his colleagues at Bar he has been regarded as a sound
        lawyer, well worthy of the high position which he had
        filled for little over two hundred
        years."&mdash;<i>Englishman</i> (<i>Calcutta</i>).
    </blockquote>

    <p>Lord HALSBURY must look to his laurels.</p>
    <hr />

    <blockquote>
        "Mr. Clement Wragge has prepared a special weather forecast
        for the year 9117. His opinion is that the year will prove
        distinctly good."&mdash;<i>New Zealand Times.</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We infer that, in Mr. WRAGGE's opinion, the War will be over
    by then.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>The Minimum.</h3>

    <p>Extract from a letter just received from H.Q. in
    France:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        "C.O.'s will take care that all ranks know that they must
        never parade before an Officer&mdash;Brigade, Regimental or
        Company&mdash;unless properly dressed, wearing at least a
        belt."
    </blockquote>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        "The few women on the platform were dressed quietly, as
        befitted the occasion, the smartest person present being
        Mr. McKenna."&mdash;<i>Illustrated Sunday Herald.</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Our contemporary might have told us what he wore.</p>

    <h2>PERSONAL PARS FROM THE WESTERN FRONT.</h2>(<i>With
    acknowledgments to some of our chatty contemporaries</i>.)

    <p>HAPPY C.-IN-C.&mdash;I saw the Commander-in-Chief to-day
    passing through the little village of X in an open car. He was
    very quietly dressed in khaki, with touches of scarlet on the
    hat and by the collar. I waved my hand to him and he returned
    the salute. It is small acts like this which endear him to all.
    I noticed that the Field-Marshal was not carrying his baton.
    Doubtless he did not wish to spoil its pristine freshness with
    the mud of the roads.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>OF COURSE.&mdash;A friend in the Guards tells me that the
    new food restrictions do not affect the men in the trenches
    very seriously. Our brave soldiers are so inured to hardships
    by now that they willingly forgo seven-course dinners.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>NOT STARVING.&mdash;While on the subject of food, the
    picture published on page 6 of to-day's issue refutes the idea
    that the Hun is starving. It represents the KAISER looking at
    some pigs. The KAISER can be distinguished by a x.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>FASHIONS FOR MEN.&mdash;Now that mid-winter is with us it is
    quite a common event to meet fur-clad denizens of the firing
    line. Some of the new season's coats are the last word in chic,
    one which I noticed yesterday made of black goat, having
    pockets of seal coney with collar and cuffs of civet. The
    wearer's feet were encased in the latest style of gum boots,
    reaching to the thigh and fastening with a buckle. These are
    being worn loose round the ankle. A green steel helmet, draped
    in sandbag material, completed the costume. The field service
    cap was not being worn inside the helmet.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>NUMBER NINE.&mdash;The Army doctors, so it seems, do not
    fully understand the delicate constitution of a friend of mine
    in the Blues, and sent him back to duty after dosing him with
    medicine, though he is suffering from pain in the foot. The
    medicine generally takes the form of a "Number Nine," the pill
    that cures all ills; but last time he went on sick parade they
    were out of stock, and he was given two "Number Fours" and a
    "Number One" instead. Rough-and-ready pharmacy. What?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>SPIRITED.&mdash;Met my old chum, Sir William &mdash;&mdash;,
    just back from the trenches. Dear old Billy, what cigars he
    used to smoke in the good old days! He tells me that when on a
    carrying fatigue the other night one of his men dropped the
    earthenware receptacle which contains Tommy's greatest
    consolation in this terrible war, and every drop of the
    precious liquid was spilt. Five minutes later a Jack Johnson
    landed beside him and put things right. <i>It gave him a rum
    jar</i>. Good, eh?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>WHERE TO LUNCH.&mdash;I am just off to lunch with my old
    pal, the Hon. Adolphus Lawrie-Carr, of the Motor Transport
    Section of the A.S.C. I have never seen him look better than he
    does now, in hunting stock and field boots, crop and spurs. He
    always gives one a first-class meal.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>THE NEXT PUSH.&mdash;I had a most interesting conversation
    the other day with Alphonse, late of the Saveloy. He is on the
    G.H.Q. Staff in a position of high trust&mdash;something to do
    with the culinary arrangements, I believe&mdash;and is, of
    course, in the know. From what he told me confidentially I can
    assure all my countless readers that there will be fighting on
    the Western Front during 1917, and, in the words of Mr. Hilary
    Bullox, "If it is not prolonged until next year, the present
    year will certainly see the end of the War." More I cannot
    divulge.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>Our Cautious Contemporaries.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        "What can be said with truth is that business in the New
        Loan for the first two days is easily AZ per cent. better
        for new money than for the same period on the occasion of
        the last loan."&mdash;<i>Evening Standard</i>.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>"ANCIENT ORDER OF HIBERNIANS.</h3>

        stationery; he announces that he will at once begin an
        active canvas of the State to revive old divisions and
        organize new ones."&mdash;<i>Texas Newspaper</i>.

        would imply that Greece contemplated an attack on General
        Sarrail's rear."&mdash;<i>Continental Daily Mail</i>.

    <h2>A WAY NOT TO PAY OLD DEBTS.</h2>

    <p>"Hullo, old thing!" said Herbert gloomily; "lots of
    Congrats. Lucky devil, you," and he sighed unobtrusively.</p>

    <p>I had forgotten that once upon a time Adela had refused to
    walk out with Herbert because of his puttees, which she said
    were so original that they distracted her attention from the
    way he proposed.</p>

    <p>Remembering this now, I offered my cousin a sympathetic
    cigarette, which he, shaking himself free from care, accepted;
    after which he began to borrow ten pounds&mdash;an achievement
    which, I am proud to say, cost him nearly twenty minutes' hard
    labour.</p>

    <p>Not so very long afterwards Adela and I had a honeymoon,
    followed by a picture-postcard from Herbert. He said he was
    sorry he hadn't been there to throw boots at us, but he was
    convalescing on the Cornish Riviera, the exact spot being
    marked with a cross; also one could not send money by postcard,
    but I was not to think he was forgetting about that fiver he
    had borrowed.</p>

    <p>The first part of this document caused Adela to wonder
    vaguely if wounded officers ought to convalesce in
    chimney-pots, but the last words gave me some twinges of a more
    sincere alarm. Was Herbert's delusion a permanency, or merely a
    slip of the pen?</p>

    <p>"Adela," I decided, "let's ask Herbert to dinner as soon as
    ever he leaves the roofs of the British Riviera."</p>

    <p>Then one day, when I was writing letters in the Mess, he
    strolled in. "Hullo!" he said, "where's the C.O.? What?... Oh,
    thanks awfully, and ... Oh, I say, good Lord! I owe you three
    quid, don't I?" and he drifted out abstractedly.</p>

    <p>"Three!" I echoed dizzily, as the door banged. I staggered
    home for the week-end.</p>

    <p>I found Adela having an excited conversation with the
    telephone in the hall.</p>

    <p>"Ooo!" she said, hanging up the receiver, "Herbert's a hero.
    He's just been telling me. And he's coming to dinner
    to-night."</p>

    <p>"I also," I responded with emotion, "have a tale to unfold,"
    and I unfolded it.</p>

    <p>When at last Herbert, moving modestly under the burden of a
    newly acquired D.S.O., arrived at the flat, hospitality and an
    unaccustomed awe withheld me from referring to so sordid a
    matter as the inconsiderable decrease in my lately-invested
    capital. Herbert, however, deprecated heroics, and, as he was
    saying good-night, came of his own accord to the subject of
    debts. He was always a conscientious fellow.</p>

    <p>"You know, old chap," he said with charming candour, as I
    saw him off from the doorstep, "you <i>must</i> remind me to
    pay up that two quid some time. I keep forgetting, and when I
    do remember, like now, I haven't any money to do it with.
    Cheero!" The door clicked and I swooned.</p>

    <p>It was very difficult; I could not even make up my mind
    whether my best policy was to stalk Herbert with vigilance or
    to avoid him as persistently as discipline allowed. On the one
    hand he wasn't the cheque-book kind of man and he wouldn't pay
    me unless he saw me. Contrariwise, he wouldn't even if he did,
    and whenever he saw me my original loan of ten gold sovereigns
    might continue its rapid decline. Finally I decided to abstain
    from his society.</p>

    <p>Shortly after this momentous decision the War Office sent
    him off to some remote part of the country, and for many months
    our financial relations remained unaltered&mdash;at any rate in
    my own estimation. He was still far away when Adela II arrived,
    so we did our best to hush her up; we thought that if we could
    smuggle her to, say, the age of ten and send her to school
    Herbert couldn't possibly come and congratulate us about her.
    That only shows how much we didn't know; for Herbert procured
    some leave three weeks later and was excitedly mounting our
    stairs within a few hours.</p>

    <p>"P'r'aps," whispered Adela bravely as he was being
    announced, "he'll forget about money&mdash;p'r'aps he'll even
    put it up a bit."</p>

    <p>I smiled cynically, and was justified ten minutes later,
    when Herbert's conscience, troubled and apologetic, reminded
    him about that guinea he owed me.</p>

    <p>At the christening it fell to half-a-quid, and, according to
    Herbert's latest allegation, it is only his rotten memory for
    postal-orders that prevents him from sending me that dollar at
    once.</p>

    <p>And so, precariously, the matter rested till to-day, when
    the final blow fell from the War Office. Herbert and I are to
    proceed to France together next Monday. On that day, if I am
    ingenious and agile enough not to meet him before, we ought to
    be about all square; after that, as far as I can see, there
    will be an inevitable moment when Herbert will turn to me with,
    "I say, old fellow, you can't let me have that ten bob you
    touched me for the other day, can you? Hate to ask you, but I
    haven't got a sou ..." But I won't&mdash;no, I won't. I will
    let my imaginary debt mount up, I will let it increase even at
    the rate at which Herbert's has decreased, but I will not pay
    it. Herbert, of course, will always be kind to me about it, for
    he is a generous creature; and every time we go into action he
    will probably wring my hand and beg me not to worry about it
    any more.</p>

    <p>"Old man," he will be saying on the twenty-ninth occasion,
    "if I got done in, promise you won't bother about that thousand
    pounds you owe me&mdash;remember you're to think of it as
    paid."</p>

    <p>I shall remember all right.</p>

    <p>The problem of the housing of the traveller-classes when all
    the hotels of London have been taken over by the Government is
    now occupying both the waking and sleeping hours (such as they
    are) of the War Cabinet, and a special department of the
    Intelligence Department has been created to deal with it on the
    roof of No. 10 Downing Street. It has not yet been decided
    whether all visitors to London should be sent back as soon as
    they arrive, or whether Sir JOSEPH LYONS should reap the sole
    benefit of their sojourn.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Although the proprietors of the Hotel des Ambassadeurs,
    Ealing, and the Grand Hotel Riche, Mile End, have offered the
    Government their premises, on the most advantageous terms to
    themselves, no arrangement has yet been effected.</p>

    <p>A deputation of officials recently visited the Zoo and made

    <p>There is absolutely no truth in the statement, circulated by

    be the control of the waves of the Channel.</p>

    <p>At the invitation of the PREMIER, whose summons came to him
    just as he was entering his car bound for Pall Mall, Mr. HARVEY

    <h2>WARS OF THE PAST.</h2>

    <h3>(<i>As recorded in the Press of the period.</i>)</h3>

    <h3>VII.</h3>

    <h3><i>From "Tempora" (Rome).</i></h3>

    <p>Admittedly, the peril is extreme. Crustumerium has fallen,
    and also Ostia. However, Janiculum, the key to the whole outer
    system of the City's defences, still stands, and there is
    accordingly no immediate cause for dismay. But we are strongly
    of the opinion&mdash;so rapid has been LARS PORSENA'S advance
    hitherto&mdash;that the bridge over the Tiber should be at once
    destroyed as a precautionary measure while there is yet time.
    We have every confidence in the continued capacity for
    resistance of the strong garrison at Janiculum, but it is
    necessary to be prepared for every eventuality; and if the
    fortress <i>should</i> fall without the bridge being demolished
    the latter would inevitably be seized by the enemy, and the
    Tiber, our last line of defence, would be lost to us.</p>

    <p>For the rest, the spirit of the people is excellent. It has
    become almost a truism to say that nowadays none is for a
    party, but all are for the State. Rich and poor have learned to
    help and respect each other. Indeed, in these brave days
    Romans, in Rome's quarrel, have poured out blood and treasure
    unsparingly for the common cause. We are like a nation of
    brothers.</p>

    <h3><i>The Secretary to the Senate announces</i>:</h3>

    <p>"The War Council met at the River Gate immediately on
    receipt of the news of the fall of Janiculum. It was decided to
    accept the offer of Port-Captain HORATIUS (S.P.Q.R.'s Own),
    SPURIUS LARTIUS (Ramnian Regt.), and HERMINIUS ("Titian
    Toughs"), who gallantly volunteered to hold the bridge-head in
    order to give time for the bridge itself to be destroyed. All
    hope of saving the town should not therefore be abandoned."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3><i>From our Special Correspondent.</i></h3>

    <p>I have just returned from the River Gate, where I was, I
    believe, the first to applaud one of the Patres Conscripti
    (commanding the Axe-and-Crowbar Volunteers), who set a fine
    example by actually starting on the demolition of the bridge
    himself. Already you could see the Tuscan hordes in the swarthy
    dust that shrouded the Western horizon. I was myself in a
    position to pick out ASTUR, who was girt with the brand which
    (I am informed by a high authority) none but he can wield.
    There is no need to describe to you the firmament-rending yell
    that rose when the presence of the false and shameful SEXTUS
    was officially notified. One saw women who hissed and even
    expectorated in his direction, and more than one child, I
    noticed, shook its small fist at him with splendid
    spirit....</p>

    <p>I am told that HORATIUS spoke out pretty plainly to the
    Senate, expressing the opinion that three men could easily hold
    the bridge-head. The gallant officer, interviewed while he was
    in the act of tightening his harness, declined to say much,
    merely expressing the opinion that everyone has got to die some
    time and that there was, after all, some satisfaction in being
    killed in a fight against odds. I confess I was favourably
    impressed by the very nonchalance of his attitude.</p>

    <p>"Latest advices show that HORATIUS has despatched ASTUR,
    and, though slightly wounded in this encounter, has been able
    to keep his place in the line. The bridge head is still being
    held and there is now a pause in the fighting. The total enemy
    casualties up to the present are estimated at: <i>Killed</i>,
    7; <i>Wounded</i>, 0; <i>Missing</i>, 0. Our own casualties
    are: <i>Killed</i>, 0; <i>Wounded</i>, 1; <i>Missing</i>, 0. A

    having failed to make good his retreat with his comrades, and

    <h3>HORATIUS SAFE.</h3>

    <h3>HOW HE SWAM THE RIVER.</h3>

    <h3>(<i>By our Special Correspondent.</i>)</h3>

    <p>HORATIUS, the only one of the "dauntless three" (as they
    have been already named) about whose safety doubts were
    entertained, has swum the river and is safe. I saw him, when
    the bridge fell, standing alone, but obviously with all his
    wits about him, despite the ninety thousand foes before and the
    broad flood behind. When he turned round he might have seen, I
    believe, from where he was standing (just where, on other
    occasions, I have stood myself) the white porch of his home.
    His lips parted as if in prayer. The next moment, pausing only
    to sheathe his ensanguined sword, he took a graceful dive into
    the river.</p>

    <p>Some moments of terrible tension ensued. When at last his
    head appeared above the surges, a cry of indescribable rapture
    went up, and I am happy to place on record the fact that I
    distinctly detected a note of generous cheering from the Tuscan
    ranks.</p>

    <p>But all was not yet over. The current ran fiercely, swollen
    high by months of rain. Often I thought him sinking&mdash;and
    indeed nearly sent in a message to that effect&mdash;but still
    again he rose. Never, I think, did any swimmer in like
    circumstances perform such a remarkable feat of natation. But
    at length he felt the bottom, was helped ashore by myself and
    the Senate, and was carried shoulder-high through the River
    Gate. I understand that some special recognition is to be made
    of his splendid feat.</p>

    <h3><i>From "Rome Chat."</i></h3>

    <p>Our frontispiece this week is a family group of brave
    Captain HORATIUS, together with the tender mother who
    (formerly) dandled him to rest, and his wife, who, it will be
    noticed, is nursing his youngest baby. We are glad to hear
    that, in conformity with the principle of settling our gallant
    soldiers on the land, a goodly tract is to be given to this
    popular hero. The story of how he held the bridge-head will
    certainly afford a stirring tale for the home-circle for a long
    time to come.</p>

    <h3>'EAD-WORK.</h3>

    <p>Bob Winter is our local carrier. His old grey mare
    Molly&mdash;or a predecessor very like her, driven by Bob's
    father before him&mdash;has jogged into town on market days as
    long as anyone in the village can remember. The weather-beaten,
    oft-patched tilt of Bob's cart must have heard in its day
    generations of village gossip, and a mere inspection of the
    cargo on the flap which lets down at the back will provide
    quite an amount of interesting information, such as "whose new
    housemaid's tin trunk be a-goin' to station already, lookee,
    and who be a-getten a new tyre to ees bicycle&mdash;see."</p>

    <p>Now, however, there is a likelihood that Bob may be called
    up; and the fate of the carrying business hangs in the
    balance.</p>

    <p>"Never mind, Bob," I said (I had overtaken him and old Molly
    sauntering up the steep hill above the village); "if it comes
    to that, you know, the women-folk will have to take turns at
    the carrying while you are away. I believe I should make rather
    a good carrier."</p>

    <p>Bob shook his head and looked evasive.</p>

    <p>"No, Miss," he said, "'twuddn' do, 'twuddn' do at all."</p>

    <p>"Come," I said, "you don't mean to say Molly would be too
    much for me?"</p>

    <p>"No, Miss, 'tain't Molly, but&mdash;well, 'tain't no job for
    a lady, ain't the carryin'; leastways, not to my way o'
    thinkin'."</p>

    <p>"Oh, but I should get the people at the shops to help me
    with the heavy things."</p>

    <p>Bob cleared his throat loudly and looked more uncomfortable
    still. Then at last he decided to take the plunge.</p>

    <p>"'Tain't the liftin' that do be troublin' I, Miss," he said
    confidentially, "'tis the 'ead-work. I don't believe there be a
    wumman livin' could do it. There be a tur'ble lot of 'ead-work
    in the carryin' business. Why, I do

    a-said to Missis, 'No, Missis, I don't want no tea; I don't

    <p>"Well, now, if I ain't a-gone an' forgot to call at old Mrs.

    <h2>THE PURIFIED PRUSSIAN.</h2>

    <blockquote>
        [Writing in <i>Die Woche</i> a well-known Baroness, a
        leader of Berlin society, discusses the transformation and
        purification of Berlin conviviality by the War. Social
        functions accompanied by eating have altogether ceased and
        given way to more refined gatherings&mdash;&aelig;sthetic
        afternoon teas and elegant evening parties&mdash;at which
        the conversation reaches heights of brilliancy unheard of
        in the old carnivorous days. Unhappily snobbery still
        prevails, "every class pretending to be richer and better
        than they are&mdash;small officials, officers, landowners,
        all pretending to be millionaires, and doing their
        pretension shabbily."]

    <h2>A FLEETING DETACHMENT.</h2>

    <p>Private Albert Snape, A.S.C. (M.T.), stepped off the
    footboard of X.33, a medi&aelig;val Vanguard, and splashed his
    way round to the driver. "I'm fair sick o' this 'ere Flanders,
    I am," he complained, expectorating dolorously into the sea of
    mud; "'spose it 'ull be up to the blinkin' axles before
    February?" He stirred the mixture with a cautious foot.</p>

    <p>"Not 'arf, ole sport," replied the driver, carefully
    unsticking a cigarette from his underlip. "But yer ought to
    'ave bin out larst winter, then yer did 'ave to sit above
    yerself to keep yer tootsies dry."</p>

    <p>"Wot&mdash;wuss than this?" exclaimed the disconsolate
    one.</p>

    <p>"Wuss!" was the withering retort. "Wy, when I tells yer that
    some o' them Naval 'Umming-birds, t'other side o' Popinjay,
    fitted out an ole Blue 'Ammersmith with a pair o' propellers
    ... Wuss!" He exhaled scornfully and gave a turn to the
    lubricator.</p>

    <p>"Any chance o' getting down Vermelly way? They say it ain't
    'arf bad there." Albert brightened up at the thought.</p>

    <p>"'Tain't likely," was the sharp and unsympathetic reply.
    "'Oo do yer think's goin' ter do this little job if they takes
    our lot away? Wy, this 'ere road is just like 'Igh 'Olborn to
    me; I knows all the 'umps and 'ollows blindfold."</p>

    <p>Albert returned to the stern sheets and considered the most
    feasible method of desertion.</p>

    <p>Half-an-hour later, when the daylight had gone, X.33,
    generously over-flowing with a detachment of the 20th
    Mudlarkers, was, in company with many other vehicles, making
    her inharmonious way along the "Wipers" road. Judging from the
    plunginess of her progress and the fluent language of the man
    of oil, it was evident that some of the "'umps and 'ollows" had
    passed from the driver's memory. Not that such a slight matter
    could damp the spirits of the passengers. Rather it served to
    entertain them.</p>

    <p>"We '<i>ave</i> gone an' fallen out of the dress-circle this
    time," a voice exclaimed after an extra steep dive into a
    badly-filled shell crater.</p>

    <p>Albert, wet and unsociable, hung gloomily on to the back
    rail.</p>

    <p>"Carn't see wot they got to be so blinkin' 'appy abart," he
    muttered savagely; "I don't believe it's 'arf bad in them
    trenches." He ruminated bitterly on the thought that his job
    was probably the worst one on the whole front, and made a
    resolve to put the matter right.</p>

    <p>When the final stopping-place had been reached and the 20th
    Mudlarkers, after the usual indescribable m&ecirc;l&eacute;e,
    had been put upon the path that would ultimately lead them (if
    they were fortunate enough to avoid all guides,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"
       id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span> philosophers and friends) to
       their trench, the man of oil was profanely grieved to
       discover that Albert Snape had abandoned X33 for the
       unknown.</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact Albert had slipped away and followed the
    Mudlarkers, with a hazy idea that a rifle would fortuitously
    present itself. That an extra unit could possibly be noticed
    never occurred to him. He had a vague intention of joining a
    cavalry regiment. Very soon he lost the Mudlarkers, and then,
    by an easy sequence of events, himself.</p>

    <p>"Wha goes there?" whispered a hoarse voice almost in his
    ear. It gave him quite an unpleasant start, but, suppressing
    his first inspiration, which was to say the Life Guards, he
    answered, "I'm a Mudlarker!"</p>

    <p>"This iss the Seaforths in supporrt," remarked the sentry;
    "ye'll be in the firrst line, na doot. Ye'll hae to go back,
    an' it's the firrst turnin' tae the left, an' keep as strecht
    as ye can." The Highlander stepped back into the deeper shadows
    and the self-recruited Mudlarker continued his career.</p>

    <p>He traversed what seemed to him an interminable number of
    trenches without encountering anyone. There was a reason for
    this lack of companionship, but it did not at first appeal to
    his imagination. Suddenly he was startled by the vicious "phut,
    phut, phut" of unpleasantly close shooting, and bullets began
    to splash and grease along the bottom of the trench,
    accompanied by the stutter of a machine gun.</p>

    <p>Miraculously untouched, he slid over the parados and lay,
    sweating with fright, in the watery furrow of a turnip
    field.</p>

    <p>The trench was one that was seldom used, being thoroughly
    exposed to enfilading fire. At stated periods through the night
    a machine gun was turned on, a proceeding which, beyond
    gratifying the Huns, had no sort of effect. Albert, in blissful
    ignorance of all such customs, floundered about amongst the
    turnips until he came across a Jack Johnson crater. From this
    he emerged even wetter than before. A little later he became
    mixed up with some barbed wire. The more be tried to get away
    the more inextricably he became involved with it. A star shell
    burst overhead, and a German sniper, seizing the chance of a
    lifetime, put in four rounds rapid fire.</p>

    <p>Albert lost the lobe of an ear and had his breeches shot
    through, but he managed to escape from the wire and find
    another furrow. Mere dampness no longer inconvenienced him,
    there were so many other things to think about. He crawled
    stealthily on his hands and knees and found the barbed wire
    again. At length he heard the welcome sound of voices. He
    crawled faster until he became aware that the voices were not
    speaking English, This discovery turned him to stone. For an
    hour&mdash;perhaps two hours&mdash;he remained as still as a
    hare in its form.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, blurred and crouching figures appeared out of the
    night. They moved quickly and silently. One of them nearly trod
    upon his hand, but he was too dazed to think of committing
    himself to either speech or action.</p>

    <p>"Give it 'em!" cried a voice a few seconds later, and the
    roar of the exploding bombs signified that it had been
    given.</p>

    <p>Instantly pandemonium broke loose. Machine gun and rapid
    rifle fire burst forth from the German front trenches, and
    streams of bullets swept over the intervening ground like a
    gigantic hail-storm; then some field batteries began to burst
    H.E. shrapnel above the disturbed area, while star shells and
    magnesium flares threw an uneven light over the whole
    scene.</p>

    <p>A breathless body cast itself down beside the now completely
    mesmerised Albert: "We ain't 'arf upset the blinkin' beehive.
    Lumme! it's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

    <p>The prone figure suddenly became silent, gave a convulsive
    kick or two and rolled over towards the man who still
    lived.</p>

    <p>It was sufficient. Something seemed to draw very tense in
    Albert's brain and his body reeled into action.</p>

    <p>Blindly and without coherent thought he ran shouting across
    the field, stumbling and falling over the slippery and uneven
    surface, but always picking himself up and flinging his body
    onward into the unknown.</p>

    <p>A subaltern, who was examining a luminous watch, received
    him at the charge as he fell into an English first-line trench.
    They struggled wildly together in the mud to the accompaniment
    of startling language on the part of the subaltern.</p>

    <p>Then Albert, having reached his limit of endurance, had the
    supreme tact to faint.</p>

    <p>A little later, in a well-found dug-out, the patient was
    refreshing himself with copious draughts of brandy.</p>

    <p>"Who are you, and what the devil are you doing here?" asked
    the still indignant officer.</p>

    <p>Albert did not hesitate longer than it takes to swallow.</p>

    <p>"Lorst me way, I 'ave, Sir. I'm with X 33, attached to
    Mechanical Transport, an' if I ain't back pretty quick my mate
    'ull fair 'ave a bloomin' fit."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>As was predicted by the sagacious man of oil, the mud upon
    the &mdash;&mdash; road is slowly climbing towards the axles,
    but in spite of this and sundry other drawbacks it would be
    hard to find a more contented spirit than that of Private
    Albert Snape, A.S.C. (M.T.).</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>LIONS AT PLAY.</h2>

    <h3>BY A SUBALTERN.</h3>

    <p>The Colonel rustles his newspaper, smites it into shape with
    a mighty fist, rips it across in a futile endeavour to fold it
    accurately, and, casting it furiously aside in a crumpled mass,
    says, after the manner of all true War Lords, "Umph." Whereupon
    the Ante-Room as one man takes cover.</p>

    <p>The Colonel then turns cumbrously in his chair, permitting
    his eye to rove round the room in search of the unwary prey. He
    smiles cynically at the intense concentration of the Auction
    parties; winces at the renewed and unnatural efforts of those
    who make music; glares unamiably at the feverish book-worms,
    and suddenly breaks into little chuckles of satisfaction. The
    Ante-Room peers cautiously round to discover the identity of
    the unfortunate victim, and chuckles in its turn. The Adjutant,
    checked in his stealthy retreat, hastens back, arranges the
    table and chess-board, pokes the fire with unnecessary energy,
    and sits down. At once the Ante-Room abandons its cover.</p>

    <p>The Colonel begins by grasping the box, turning it upside
    down, and spilling the contents over the sides of the table.
    The Adjutant immediately apologises for his clumsiness. The
    Colonel then liberally spreads out the pieces, selects two
    pawns, and offers the Adjutant the choice of two fists. The
    Adjutant chooses. Each fist opens to disclose a white pawn. The
    Colonel's expansive smile over his little joke quickly turns to
    a frown at the Adjutant's exaggerated laughter. He suspects the
    Adjutant. He seizes two more pieces, offers his opponent
    another choice, but, to the latter's huge delight and his own
    discomfiture, eventually discovers that both are black. He
    accordingly makes use of his casting vote and selects
    white.</p>

    <p>The Colonel plays a smashing game. When it is his turn to
    move he never pauses to make up his mind. His mind is already
    made up. All he has to do, immediately the Adjutant has
    finished touching up his position, is to move the piece his eye
    has been piercing throughout the long period of his opponent's
    cautious deliberation. When the Colonel moves a piece he may be
    said to get there. All obstructions are ruthlessly swept aside
    with a callous indifference to Hague Conventions.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"
       id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span> Should a knight haply descend
       from the clouds and settle on the correct square it arrives
       more by luck than judgment. Tradition alleges that whenever
       the Colonel is called upon to move his king in the earlier
       stages of the game all lights are turned off from the
       neighbouring town in accordance with the Defence of the
       Realm Regulations. However true this may be&mdash;the
       responsibility rests on the Padre's capable
       shoulders&mdash;when his king is moved in the later stages
       the Colonel pushes it along by half-squares in a haphazard
       and preoccupied manner. He invariably fills his pipe when
       the end is in sight, but leaves it unlighted so that he may
       cover his ultimate defeat by a general demolition of
       matches.</p>

    <p>On this occasion the Adjutant skilfully snipes the Colonel's
    queen in the sixth move. The Colonel immediately retrieves the
    piece from the box, asks where it was before, examines it with
    the essence of loathing and revolt, removes it out of his
    sight, and refuses to take it back, although he had mistaken it
    for another piece. In retaliation he proceeds to concentrate
    all his effectives on his opponent's queen, and, after
    sacrificing the flower of his forces, drives the attack home
    and gains his objective with the greatest enthusiasm. He
    remarks that the capture was costly, but that honour is
    satisfied, and would the waiter kindly approach within
    ear-shot?</p>

    <p>While the Adjutant is working up his offensive on the
    Colonel's right flank, the Colonel himself is making
    independent sallies on the left, unless, of course, he is
    compelled to march his king out of a congested district into
    more open country. On the rare occasions when he is at a loss
    for a moment what to do he makes it a practice to move a pawn
    one square in order to gain time. By this method, unexpectedly
    but none the less jubilantly, he recovers his queen&mdash;only
    to see it laid low again by enfilading fire from a perfectly
    obvious redoubt.</p>

    <p>After twenty minutes of battle the Colonel's area becomes
    positively draughty, and the sole survivors of his dashing but
    sanguinary counter-attack, the king and two pawns, have assumed
    the bored and callous air of a remnant that has fought too long
    and is called upon to fight again. The Colonel has just
    unceremoniously pushed his sovereign to the rear with a flick
    of his nervous irritated little finger. His opponent can
    obviously bring him to his knees in two moves. Instead of which
    the Adjutant brazenly commences with massed bands and colours
    flying to execute a masterly tactical advance with the whole of
    his command&mdash;cavalry, infantry, church and tanks, in order
    to achieve the destruction of the two bantam bodyguards.</p>

    <p>This is not playing the game, and the Colonel fumes inwardly
    and frets outwardly. In the intervals of pressing down the
    unlit tobacco in his pipe with an oscillating thumb, he
    alternately pokes his king out of the corner and pulls it back
    again; while his transparent impulse is to scrap the board,
    wreck the ante-room and run amok. The Adjutant continues his
    innocent amusement until at last the pleasure wanes. The two
    heroic pawns are carried decently off, and he apologetically
    whispers his suspicions of a checkmate to his commanding
    officer.</p>

    <p>The Colonel brushes aside the Mess President's
    tinder-lighter, shatters the mute triumph of the serried black
    ranks of the hostile forces with one superb elevation of the
    eyebrows, smashes three matches in quick succession, and proves
    that all the time his mind has been preoccupied with weightier
    matters by saying after the manner of all true War Lords,
    "Umph."</p>

    <h2>A LUCID EXPLANATION.</h2>

    <p>It was my task to collect from their relatives particulars
    as to the whereabouts of the wounded of our neighbourhood, for
    the purposes of our local report. It wanted five minutes to
    twelve, the sacred dinner-hour of the British artisan, and one
    name remained upon my list, against which was a pencilled note,
    "Reported returning home." Did that mean that he was disabled?
    And should I manage to gather the necessary information before
    the clock struck?</p>

    <p>I knocked at the door, which was opened by a woman wearing a
    canvas apron with a very tight string, her head surmounted by
    hair-curlers and a cloth cap.</p>

    <p>"Yes, thanking you kindly," she replied in answer to my
    question, "me son '<i>as</i> been wounded. 'Eard of it from the
    War Office. This war's a shocking business."</p>

    <p>I expressed my sympathy and asked for particulars.</p>

    <p>"Yer see, he was at Gallipoli."</p>

    <p>"At Gallipoli? Then it must have been some time ago? I
    understood&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"It was this way. Me son, 'e ses to me, 'Mother,' 'e says,
    'don't you worry, but I've had a toe took off.' 'E never was
    one to put up a great shout 'bout hisself, nor nothink of that.
    They took 'im down to their base 'ospital. Leeharver's the
    name. Perhaps you know it?"</p>

    <p>I cast my mind over the &AElig;gean Islands, from which
    Mudros sprang up very large, and everything else sank into
    oblivion. "I'm afraid I don't," I owned apologetically.</p>

    <p>"Thought perhaps you might. L-E first word, H-A-V-R-E
    second&mdash;Leeharver."</p>

    <p>"Oh-h, to be sure, Le Havre. I mean&mdash;yes, now you
    mention it, I think I have heard of it. And is your son still
    there?"</p>

    <p>Me son, 'e ses the vermin there was something shocking, and
    they spent all their spare time 'unting theirselves."</p>

    <p>"What? <i>not</i> in the hospital? Oh, I see; you mean in
    the trenches."</p>

    <p>"And 'im," she continued, not noticing my remark, 'and 'im
    that partic'lar 'bout 'is linen; couldn't use a 'andkerchief
    not unless it was spotless; must 'av a clean one every Sunday
    as reg'lar as the week come round. It do seem 'ard, don't it?
    They've pinched his sweater too. S'pose I shall 'av to get 'im
    another, s'pose I shall; but it's a job to know how to get
    along these times. And now margarine's up this week, that's the
    latest."</p>

    <p>"But your son," I ventured tentatively&mdash;"is his foot
    still bad?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, 'is <i>foot's</i> right enough. It's 'is teeth that's
    the worry. 'E ses to me, 'Mother,' he ses, 'afore I can do any
    good I must 'ave me teeth seen to.' Oh, this fighting's cruel
    work!"</p>

    <p>Could he have been wounded in the jaw? The thought was
    horrible, but I remarked with affected cheerfulness, "Well,
    come, anyhow he is able to write."</p>

    <p>"Oh, 'e can <i>write</i> right enough&mdash;got the prize at
    school for 'rithmatic, 'e did."</p>

    <p>"Yes, but I mean if he is able to write he can't be so very
    bad."</p>

    <p>"Oh, 'e didn't <i>write</i> that. That was August come a
    twelvemonth. The very first thing they done to him was to take
    out pretty near 'alf 'is teeth. The military authorities do
    pull you about something shocking."</p>

    <p>"And where did he go after Hav&mdash;after Leehar&mdash;I
    mean after the hospital?" I was getting rather bewildered.</p>

    <p>"Oh, 'e went to the War right enough; but 'is digestion's
    that bad. They said 'e'd feel a lot better once 'is teeth was
    was out, but 'e ses, 'Mother,' 'e ses, 'you want a mouth full
    of teeth to eat this bullet beef what they give us.' Next thing
    was they set him to drive them machines."</p>

    <p>"What machines would those be?" I asked, groping for a
    little light.</p>

    <p>"Why, them motors as they use out there. 'E got meddling
    with one of 'em, and it was the nearest thing 'e didn't 'ave
    'is 'and in a jelly; the machine didn't act proper, or
    somethink o' that."</p>

    <p>"And do you mean that his hand was injured?"</p>

    <p>"Not as I've 'eard on," came the prompt reply.</p>

    <p>"Well, but I thought you said your son <i>had</i> been
    wounded."</p>

    <p>"Ah, yes, that was 'is toe, yer see; sent 'im down to the
    base 'ospital, Leeharver."</p>

    <p>"Yes, you told me that; but I heard he might be coming home.
    I was afraid perhaps he was disabled."</p>

    <p>"That's right. 'E's coming 'ome right enough. Ought to be
    'ere in 'bout five minutes. 'Ope 'is dinner 'asn't spiled time
    I've stood 'ere talking to you."</p>

    <p>"Well, what <i>is</i> the matter with him then?" I asked
    desperately.</p>

    <p>"Dunno there's anything partic'lar wrong with 'im. 'E's
    going to get married to-morrer, if that's what you mean. 'Ope
    it won't be the beginning of fresh troubles for 'im. But you
    never know what's coming next."</p>

    <p>I agreed that you never did.</p>

    <h2>LETTERS FROM MACEDONIA.</h2>

    <h3>III.</h3>

    <p>Jerry, my lad,&mdash;We have lost a dear friend, and with
    him, alas, the piping days of peace. No, he is not dead, or
    even moribund, but his friendship for us lives no longer. His
    name is Feodor, and he is a Bulgar comitadjus, or whatever is
    the singular of "comitadji," and he lived until lately in No. 2
    Dugout, Hyde Park, just over the way.</p>

    <p>It is a moot point which delighted us the more, Feodor's
    charming manner or his exquisite trousers. These two
    characteristics were the more pleasing because of their perfect
    contrast; for whereas his manner was refined and retiring, his
    trousers were distinctly aggressive in their flaunting
    shameless redness.</p>

    <p>Feodor's appearances were at first spasmodic. This was only
    natural, seeing that he had not yet instilled into us his own
    attractive habit of <i>laisser aller</i> and <i>laisser
    faire</i>, and that his red trousers offered such a beautiful
    mark.</p>

    <p>He would appear suddenly, smile seraphically towards us, and
    then disappear before our snipers could get on to him. At first
    of course we tried to pot him, but gradually our ferocity gave
    way to amazement and then to tolerance. At last came a day when
    Feodor climbed on to his parapet and made us a pretty little
    speech. We cheered him loudly, although we didn't understand
    much of it. Next day we brought down an interpreter
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"
       id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span> and asked Feodor for an
       encore. His second performance was even more spirited than
       the first, and after a graceful vote of thanks to our
       benefactor we asked the interpreter to oblige.</p>

    <p>It appeared that from his boyhood Feodor had been
    apprenticed to an assistant piano-tuner in Varna. Rosy days of
    rapid promotion followed, and the boy, completely wrapped up in
    his profession, soon became a deputy assistant piano-tuner.
    Then followed the old, old story of vaulting ambition.</p>

    <p>The youth, his head turned by material success, sought to
    consolidate his social position by a marriage above his
    station, and dared to aspire to the hand of a full
    piano-tuner's daughter.</p>

    <p>The old man tried gentle dissuasion at first, but the
    obstinate pertinacity of the stripling made him gradually lose
    patience. He was a hale and hearty veteran, and when the
    situation came to a climax his method of dealing with it was
    stern and thorough.</p>

    <p>Seizing the hapless Feodor during an evening call he
    interned him in the vitals of a tuneless Baby Grand, and for
    three hours played on him CHOPIN'S polonaise in A flat major,
    with the loud pedal down. On his release Feodor had lost his
    reason and rushed to the nearest police-station to ask to be
    sent to the Front immediately. His object, he explained, was to
    end the War. The Bulgar authorities thought the plan worth
    trying and sent him off as a comitadjus; and to these
    circumstances we were indebted for his society.</p>

    <p>Every day we saw more and more of Feodor, and we grew to
    love him. As to sniping him now&mdash;the idea never entered
    our beads. Accordingly, while a deafening strafe proceeded
    daily on both sides of us, we remained in a state of idyllic
    peace and hatelessness.</p>

    <p>Then arrived the cruel day when the Brass Hats came round,
    and a large and important General asked us&mdash;</p>

    <p>"But are you being offensive enough to the enemy in
    front?"</p>

    <p>"Offensive to Feodor, Sir? Impossible!"</p>

    <p>"You <i>must</i> be offensive," he rejoined. "I don't think
    there is sufficient hate in this part of the line."</p>

    <p>It was this unfortunate moment that Feodor chose to step on
    to his parapet and call out cheerfully to the Great
    Man&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Good morning, John<i>ee</i>!"</p>

    <p>For one tense moment I thought the General would burst. By
    an effort he pulled himself together, however, and shouted to
    my troops in a voice of thunder&mdash;</p>

    <p>"At That Person in front&mdash;fifteen rounds rapid.
    Fire!"</p>

    <p>We had to do it, of course, and, although I think most of
    our sights were a little high, accidents <i>will</i> happen.
    Feodor emitted one unearthly shriek, and his time back towards
    home would, if it had been taken, make a world's championship
    record.</p>

    <p>I don't think he was physically hurt; but his poor trousers
    were badly punctured!...</p>

    <p>Our friend, Jerry, may not be lost, but he is certainly gone
    behind.</p>

    <h3>No. I.</h3>

    <p class="center"><i>From Arthur Vivian, Bury Street, St.
    James's, to Mrs. Morton, Dockington Hall, Bucks.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR MRS. MORTON,&mdash;Just a line to thank you very
    sincerely for my delightful visit. It was like old times to see
    you "all gathered together in hospitable Dockington and to find
    that the War, terrible as it is, has not altogether abolished
    pleasant human intercourse in England, in spite of what the
    Dean said. But then Deans are privileged persons.</p>

    <p>I am sorry to say, by the way, that in the hurry of
    departure this morning I took away the wrong umbrella and left
    my own. I am sending back the changeling with all proper
    apologies. Would you mind sending me mine? It has a crook
    handle (cane) and a plain silver band with my initials engraved
    on it. Please give my love to Harry and the children.</p>

    <p class="center">Yours always sincerely,</p>

    <h3>No. II.</h3>

    <p class="center"><i>From the Dean of Marchester to Mrs.
    Morton</i>.</p>

    <p>DEAR MRS. MORTON,&mdash;I desire to thank you for three most
    agreeable days spent in congenial company. You have indeed
    mastered the secret of making your guests feel at home, and
    Dockington even in war-time is still Dockington. Pray give my
    warm regards to Mr. Morton and remember me suitably to the dear
    children. I wish they wouldn't keep on growing up as they do;
    childhood is so delightful.</p>

    <p>I find to my great regret that by some inexplicable mistake
    I took away with me an umbrella that is not mine. I am sending
    it back to you, and shall be deeply beholden to you if you will
    pack up and send to me the one I left. It is an old one,
    recognisable by its cane handle (crook) and an indiarubber ring
    round the shaft. Pray accept my apologies for the trouble I am
    giving you.</p>

    <p class="center">Yours very sincerely,</p>

    <p class="center"><i>From Brigadier-General Barton to his
    Sister, Mrs. Morton</i>.</p>

    <p>DEAR MARY,&mdash;You gave me a capital time. There's a
    slight difference between Dockington and the trenches. I'm not
    as a rule a great performer with clergymen, but I liked your
    Dean. By the way, when I dashed off your man put somebody
    else's umbrella in with me, instead of my own, which is a natty
    specimen. The one I've got is an old gamp with a stout
    indiarubber ring to it. I haven't time to send it back. Every
    moment is taken up, as I cross to France to-night. Besides, how
    can you pack such a thing as an umbrella? It's much too long.
    Keep mine till we meet again. Best love to Harry and the
    kids.</p>

    <h3>No. IV.</h3>

    <p class="center"><i>From Arthur Vivian to Mrs. Morton</i>.</p>

    <p>DEAR MRS. MORTON,&mdash;I wired you this morning asking you
    to do nothing about my umbrella. The fact is I have found it at
    my rooms, and I am forced to the conclusion that I never took
    it with me to Dockington at all. I am awfully sorry to have
    given you all this trouble. It shall be a lesson to me never to
    take my umbrella anywhere, or rather never to think I've taken
    it, when, as a matter of fact, I haven't.</p>

    <h3>No. VI.</h3>

    <p class="center"><i>From Mrs. Morton to her Sister, Lady
    Compton</i>.</p>

    <p>... We had a few friends at Dockington last week, not a real
    party, but just a few old shoes&mdash;Tom, Arthur Vivian and
    the Dean of Marchester and Mrs. Dean. Since they went away I've
    had the most awful time with their umbrellas. They all took
    away with them the wrong ones, and then wrote to me to send
    them their right ones. Arthur Vivian never brought one, and
    whose he took away I can't say. In fact I've been exposed to an
    avalanche of returning umbrellas, and Parkins has spent all his
    time in doing up the absurd things and posting them. He has
    just celebrated his seventieth birthday, and these umbrellas
    have ruined what's left of his temper. Umbrellas still keep
    pouring in, and nobody ever seems by any chance to get the
    right one. It's the most discouraging thing I've ever been
    involved in. As far as I can make out the Dean's umbrella is
    now in the trenches with Tom. If ever I have a party at
    Dockington again I shall write, "No umbrellas by request," on
    the invitations.</p>

    <p>When the eminent in other branches of art take to
    literature, criticism must naturally be tempered with respect.
    This is much how I feel after reading Sir WILLIAM RICHMOND'S
    <i>The Silver Chain</i> (PALMER AND HAYWARD). Probably,
    however, I should have enjoyed it more had not the publishers
    indulged in a wrapper-paragraph of such unbounded eulogy. If
    anybody is to call this novel "a work of great artistic
    achievement," and praise its "philosophy, psychology,
    delightful sense of humour, subtle analysis" and all the rest,
    I should prefer it to be someone less interested in the wares
    thus pushed. For my part I should be content to call <i>The
    Silver Chain</i> by no means an uninteresting story, the work
    of a distinguished man, obviously an amateur in the craft of
    letters, who nevertheless has pleased himself (and will give
    pleasure to others) by working into it many pen-pictures of
    scenes in Egypt and Rome and Sicily, full of the glowing colour
    that we should expect from their artist-author. But the tale
    itself, the unrewarded love of the middle-aged "Philosopher"
    for the not specially attractive heroine <i>Mary</i>, and the
    subordinate very Byronic romance of <i>Herbert</i> and
    <i>Annunziata</i>, quite frankly recalls those early
    manuscripts that most novelists must have burnt before they
    were quit of boyhood, or preserved to smile over. Still, in
    these winter days, when only Prime Ministers go to Rome (and
    then not to bask) and Luxor is equidistant with the moon, you
    may well find respite in a book so full of sunshine and
    memories of happy places; but I am bound to repeat my warning
    that your fellow-travellers will perhaps not be quite such
    stimulating society as the publishers would have you
    expect.</p>

    <p>Sir THEODORE COOK has already done sound work in dealing
    with German methods, and in <i>The Mark of the Beast</i>
    (MURRAY) he pursues his labours a step further. So careful is
    he to give incontestable proofs for the charges he brings
    against the Huns that even the most an&aelig;mic neutrals must
    find a difficulty in reading this volume without recognising
    the truth. Especially he emphasizes the dangers of peace-making
    with an enemy whose whole policy and programme have been based
    on lies. And if he insists many times and again upon this point
    he has his excuse in the fact that some of us are so
    extraordinarily forgetful and forgiving that we cannot be
    reminded too often of what the future has in store for us if we
    do not now remember the past. With such an absolutely flawless
    case in his hands I find myself wishing sometimes that Sir
    THEODORE had been less prodigal of the denunciatory language
    which he hurls at Teutonic heads. Not for a moment would I
    suggest that the Hun does not deserve vituperation, but I am
    inclined to think that a less violent manner of attack is more
    effective. In his own way, however, Sir THEODORE is inimitable,
    and I can pay no higher praise to his book than to say that I
    know of no War-literature so admirably calculated to make
    BETHMANN-HOLLWEG ("more double than his name") really sorry for
    himself. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
       id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span></p>

    <p>The War has not been lacking in fine memorials of the dead.
    To what extent the Germans have commemorated the fallen I have
    no notion; but in France and Italy the papers constantly print
    tender and eloquent tributes, usually to the young. And in
    England we have the same thing too, touchingly, proudly and
    generously done. For the most part such tributes are mere
    records, but now and then they reconstruct; and the most
    remarkable example of such reconstruction&mdash;to the world at
    large, absolute creation&mdash;is the memoir of <i>Charles
    Lister</i> (UNWIN), which his father, Lord RIBBLESDALE, and
    some devoted friends have, with perfect biographical tact,
    prepared. But for CHARLES LISTER'S untimely death, leading his
    men against the Turks in July, 1915, most of the letters in
    this book would never have been printed at all; for whatever
    his career might have become&mdash;and he was a man apart and
    bound for distinction&mdash;and however great a record were
    his, the early years could not be thus liberally illumined. But
    since death decreed that these early years&mdash;he was not
    quite twenty-eight when he was wounded for the third time and
    succumbed&mdash;should constitute all his career, we have this
    notable and beautiful book. If one had to put but a single
    epithet to it I should choose "radiant." At Eton, at Balliol,
    at the Embassies in Rome and Constantinople, and in the Army,
    CHARLES LISTER shed radiance. All his many friends testify to
    this. As for his letters, they are clear and gay and human; and
    they have also a sagacity that many older and more determined
    observers of life might envy; while that one to Lady DESBOROUGH
    upon the death of his great friend, JULIAN GRENFELL, is
    literature. Every page is interesting, but some are far more
    than that; and at the end one has almost too moving a concept
    of an ardent idealistic English gentleman met too late.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>At first sight, perhaps, <i>Nothing Matters</i> (CASSELL)
    may sound to you a somewhat, shall I say, transatlantic title
    for a book published in these days, when we are all learning
    how enormously everything matters. But this emotion will only
    last till you have read Sir HERBERT BEERBOHM TREE'S disarming
    little preface. Personally, it left me regretting only one
    thing in the volume (or, to be more accurate, outside it),
    which was the design of its very unornamental wrapper&mdash;a
    lapse, surely, from taste, for which it would probably be quite
    unfair to blame the writer of what lies within. This is almost
    all of it excellent fooling, and includes a brace of longish
    short-stories (rather in the fantastic style of brother MAX);
    some fugitive pieces that you may recall as they flitted
    through the fields of journalism; with, for stiffening, a
    reprint of the author's admirable lecture upon "The Importance
    of Humour in Tragedy." This is a title that you may well take
    as a motto for the whole book. It will have, I think, a warm
    welcome from Sir HERBERT'S many friends and admirers, even
    should it turn out to be the case that some of his plots have
    been (in his own quaintly attractive phrase) "prophetically
    plagiarised" by other writers. Certainly this welcome will not
    be lessened by the knowledge that all profits from the sale of
    the volume are to go to support a cause that, to all who love
    the Stage, will be far indeed from not mattering&mdash;the fund
    to supplement the incomes of the wives and families of actors
    at the Front. You may regard it therefore as the lightest of
    comedies played, like so many others, in the cause of charity,
    and put down your money with an approving conscience.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Let no one whose heart has been touched beyond mere
    vicarious pride in the achievement of our brothers-in-arms at
    the gate of Paris allow himself to miss the detailed narrative
    of HENRI DUGARD in <i>The Battle of Verdun</i> (HUTCHINSON). A
    good translation by F. APPLEBY HOLT, rather exceptional in
    these days of hurried conveyancing, does not detract from the
    vigour and movement of the story. We, who only saw the long
    agony through the medium of the always inadequate and discreet
    technicalities of the <i>communiqu&eacute;s</i>, could form no
    real impression of the kind of fighting or of the results of
    each phase of it. The author has collected the accounts or
    reports, so that the strokes and counter-strokes (for there was
    nothing passive in this siege) of the epic combats round
    Douamont, Fort Vaux, the Woevre, Malancourt, Avocourt and the
    Mort Homme are intelligibly reconstructed. Comment in the form
    of personal anecdotes of individual heroism is added. Perhaps
    the most illuminating touch is in the letter of poor Feldwebel
    KARL GARTNER, which was to have been despatched to his mother
    by a friend going on leave, so as to escape the Censor's eye.
    It began in a mood of robustious confidence and ended (or
    rather was interrupted by GARTNER'S capture) on the most
    despairing note. And this was seven months before the most
    brilliant counter-attack in the history of the War slammed the
    door once for all in the face of the enemy.</p>

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
